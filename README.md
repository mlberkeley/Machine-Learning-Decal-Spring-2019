# Machine-Learning-Decal-Spring-2019

Welcome to the Machine Learning Decal! In this course, you will discover how to analyze and manipulate data in Python, go over (and implement!) fundamental and practical statistical and deep learning learning models, as well as learn how to ask the right questions in order to tackle data-driven problems. 

This page, as well as the class Piazza page, will be the primary forms of communication throughout the course. We will be posting all lectures and assignments here as the semester progresses. 

[Applications](https://tinyurl.com/mld-apply) are now released and will be due **Friday, February 1 at 11:59pm**!

Just as a general reminder, please answer these questions as honestly as possible so we can make sure this class is a good fit for you.
