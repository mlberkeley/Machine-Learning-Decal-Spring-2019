    "Today we will explore the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) of generating adversarial examples. You can find the paper that introduces it at this link if you are interested in reading more about it: https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this method is in a sense the reversal of backpropagation. This is because we want to calculate the gradient of the cost (same as backprop so far) with respect to the input image pixels (different since with respect to model weights for backprop). In a sense, we want to know how perturbing each pixel will affect the cost, which will in turn affect what label the machine learning model classifies an image as. Once we know this, we know exactly how to exploit and perturb the image the minimal amount in order to get the model to classify it as a different label. Mathematically, FGSM takes the gradient computed from the description above, and converts each number into either +1 or -1 depending on its sign. Then, it multiplies this by a very small epsilon value and adds it to the original image. This new resulting image will then be classified incorrectly by the model this attack was created against. Pretty terrifying how easy it is to fool these models, huh.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function used in this attack is the cross entropy loss between what the model predicts, and the actual label used. To get the label the model predicts that the loss is run on, you will need to actually call the model on the input image. The result of this is what is used for the loss function described."
